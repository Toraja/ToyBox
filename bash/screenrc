# Fix colour
# Vim does not show any colour by default, and this will set environment variable "TERM" to "screen-256color".
# However, if screen itself does not support 256 color (in which case recompile is required), colour will be limited.
term screen-256color

# This sets command key (first char) and meta key (second char)
# meta key sends command key to the terminal
# e.g. The below causes pressing C-Zz to send C-Z to terminal
escape ^Zz

# Restore suspend command (overwritten by escape setting)
bind Z suspend

# Move around
bind ^J focus down
bind ^K focus up
bind ^H focus left
bind ^L focus right
bind ^T focus top
bind ^B focus bottom
bind I focus prev

# Customise keybind in select mode
# `X=Y` means Y will have the function of X
# literal "^" must be escaped by "\"
markkeys "\^=H:$=L"
